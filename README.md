<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

ForkSpy is a GitHub repository tracking tool that notifies users when their tracked repositories are forked. It helps developers stay informed about their project's reach and impact by providing real-time email notifications whenever a fork occurs.

Here's why you should use forkspy:
* Stay Informed Instantly ‚Äì Get real-time email notifications whenever someone forks your repository. No more manually checking GitHub!
* See how your open-source work spreads and attracts contributors. Identify which projects are gaining traction.
* Simply sign in with GitHub, select the repositories you want to track, and let ForkSpy handle the rest.
*  Engage with developers who fork your project and encourage contributions to improve your codebase.

### Built With

* NextJS
* TailwindCSS
* OAuth
* TypeScript
* ShadCN
* MongoDB
* ReactIcons

<!-- TESTING -->
## Testing

ForkSpy has a comprehensive test suite using Vitest for unit testing and React Testing Library for component testing. Tests cover:

* Utility functions
* Custom hooks
* API routes
* Component behavior
* Error handling

### Running Tests Locally

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run tests once
npm run test

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests with UI
npm run test:ui
```

### CI/CD

We use GitHub Actions for continuous integration. Every pull request and push to the main branch triggers:

1. **Test Suite** - All unit and integration tests
2. **Linting** - Code quality checks with ESLint
3. **Build** - Application build verification
4. **Coverage** - Test coverage reporting

The CI/CD badge at the top of this README shows the current pipeline status for the main branch.

To see detailed test reports and coverage, check the "Actions" tab in the GitHub repository.
